# Birds Aren't Real on Twitter, Apparently ⛔🐦‍⬛
## Introduction
This is a small data analysis project that peers into the brief popularity of the #BirdsArentReal movement, a parody movement/conspiracy theory that began in roughly 2017 and reached its peak in the early 2020's. The theory is more or less summed up in the hashtag: all birds, at some point in time, were "replaced them with identical drone replicas designed to spy on the American public" (quoting the official BirdsAren'tReal Twitter account.
## Datasets and Methodology📈
This project only uses two datasets. The first and primary dataset was [taken from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/birds-arent-real-on-twitter-either), and it contains all of the Twitter data relating to #BirdsArentReal between the end of 2021 and start of 2022. The second dataset was [taken from Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/explore?geo=Worldwide&date=all&q=Birds%2520Aren%27t%2520Real) and simply tracks the frequency of search data for the phrase 'Birds Aren't Real.'
